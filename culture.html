        <h1>Scottish Culture 🎵</h1>
        <p>
            Scottish culture is one of the richest in Europe.

            <h2>Traditional Clothing</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional Scottish clothing is symbolized by the kilt,
                a garment originally worn by Highland men.
                Each kilt is made from tartan, a patterned fabric that
                represents a specific clan or family.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, kilts are worn during special occasions such as weddings,
                festivals, and national celebrations, symbolizing pride
                and respect for Scottish heritage.

            <h2>Music and Dance</h2>
            <p>
                Music plays a central role in Scottish culture.
                The bagpipes are the most iconic instrument,
                often played during ceremonies, parades, and historic events.
            </p>
            <p>
                Traditional dances such as Highland dancing
                require strength, precision, and rhythm.
                These dances are performed worldwide and keep
                Scottish traditions alive.
